### [Remove Items Using splice()](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-data-structures/remove-items-using-splice)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
The `splice()` function must be called on the `arr` array in order to remove ` or more elements from the center of the array.

## HINTS
### Hint 1
The array `arr` currently adds up to the value of 27.  Simply remove as many elements from `arr`, so the sum of the remaining elements is `10`.
### Hint 2
Think about which group of consecutive elements you can remove so that the only elements left sum to 10.
